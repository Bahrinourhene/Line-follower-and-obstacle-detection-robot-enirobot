# Line-follower-and-obstacle-detection-robot-enirobot
Created an intelligent Line Follower and Obstacle Detection Robot for the EniRobots competition at Eni Carthage. we integrated Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensor, Infrared Tracking Sensor (TCRT), and DC motors to build a versatile and efficient robot. This project exemplified the application of robotics and automation in real-world scenarios.
